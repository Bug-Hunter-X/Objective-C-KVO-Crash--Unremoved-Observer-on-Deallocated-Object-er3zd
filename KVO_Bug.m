This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  The issue stems from not properly removing observers when they are no longer needed.  If an object is deallocated while it still has observers registered on another object, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  Specifically, sending messages to a deallocated object will result in a crash.
